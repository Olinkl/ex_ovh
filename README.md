# ExOvh

ExOvh is an unofficial client library to make it easier to interact with both the [Ovh](https://api.ovh.com/) api 
and the [Hubic](https://api.hubic.com/) api.

## Note 

This is an unofficial client to the OVH api and is not maintained by OVH.

## <<TODO>> Add Proper Readme


- [ ] *Needed* generate hex docs
- [ ] *Needed* generate release and publish to hex packages
- [ ] *Needed* add proper readme file
- [ ] *Needed* *Tests* add basic tests for most api calls.
- [ ] *Needed* *Tests* verify naming of the genservers works right.

 
- [ ] *Maybe* add sensitive keys, secrets, etc to system env and allow the config.exs to get variables from `System`.
- [ ] *Maybe* improve error handling for unexpected responses if possible - hard to find good documentation for expected error responses.
- [ ] *Maybe* add a time to live configuration for the validity period of the ovh credential token
- [ ] *Maybe* Add some further validations during the mix tasks.
- [ ] *Maybe* Add request helper functions to create folders in the hubic api.
